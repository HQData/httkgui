#httk / EFSA to-do list

#DAY ONE:
# * half-life calc's
# * CLh addition, CLr addition
# * user-defined values of parameters -> modify add_chemtable

#half-life -> to be added in Shiny
t = 4 # time in hours at which N(t) is taken
Nt = 3.444314 # quantity at time t (less than Cmax/2)
N0 = 11.086042 # Cmax or peak
halflife = t/(log((Nt/N0), 1/2))

# remove use.qrenal option and automatically use FR, KTS if they are available
# calc_renal_clearance function
# add CLh from line 20 in cacl_total_clearance.R
# separate function if data is available

# make sure shaded area is displayed if it's done with MC

# 

#DAY TWO:
# * Shiny app input/output

* coordinates in plots
* plots side-by-side and single displays
* choose cr interval to display (95%, 50%, custom)
* Cmax, AUC (not over time, but total value over time of simulation), halflife as numeric outputs
* export
* custom compound name
* edit input values to parameterize_pbtk
